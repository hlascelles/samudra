### Ingredients:

* 400g rhubarb
* 75g sugar
* 3 tbsp port (optional)

* 100g cold butter
* 75g flour
* 75g oats
* 50g sugar
* a bit of salt
* almond flakes

### Methods:

* Preheat the oven to 200C.
* Chop the rhubarb into pieces (not too small), mix with sugar and port (optional) directly in the baking dish.
* With your hands mix flour, oats, sugar, salt and cubes of cold butter. Shape into clumps of random size and shape and scatter on top of the rhubarb.
* Bake for 15 min, then scatter almond flakes on top and continue baking until the rhubarb is tender and the top is crisp and golden (about 30 min in total).

**Serving suggestions:** Sourness of rhubarb goes well with a scoop of plain ice cream.

**Note:** Use whatever is in season - peaches, apples, etc.
