### 1. Plastic Waste Management Programme: A Partnership

**UNDP ID:** 00100826 <br/>
**Dates:** Jan 2018 - Jun 2024 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** many cities and villages in India <br/>
**Budget:** 13.17 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** The Coca-Cola Company 60%, Hindustan Unilever, Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) India, CSR Trust for SDGs in India (CTSI), The Coca-Cola Foundation, UNDP, Governments Of Uttarakhand and Odisha

The focus of this project is on waste pickers (referred to as Safai Sathis in India) and Material Recovery Facilities (MRFs, referred to as Swachhata Kendras in India) where waste sorting, shredding and baling takes place.

**Partnership with Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages (HCCB)**

The key part of this project was to set up MRFs and waste collection systems in cities across India and to support them through enterprise partnerships.
This was preceded by a selection process, surveys, meetings, risk assessments and legal agreements; and followed by performance monitoring to enhance recycling rates.
Local waste pickers, recyclers, NGOs, shops, hospitals and educational institutions were engaged. 
The project was rolled out in 13 cities in 2018 and in 16 more cities in 2019. 
By the end of 2021 the total number of cities reached 31 and 22 MRFs had been established. 
Through these MRFs approximately 23,000 tonnes of plastic waste have been collected every year from 2019 until 2021. 
The target for 2022 is to collect more than 67,000 tonnes of plastic waste and onboard 9,000 more waste pickers. 

To support these activities, the following actions have been taken or planned:
* an app for use by local governments and recycling partners rolled out in 11 cities, with plans to cover all participating cities
* 84 waste picker Self Help Groups (SHGs) have been established across 18 cities
* almost 2000 meetings have been conducting in participating cities with local stakeholders including municipal corporations and councils, CSOs, NGOs, educational institutions, corporate partners, waste picker SHGs, recyclers, waste collectors, municipal contractors, etc.
* awareness campaigns promoting segregation of plastic waste at source conducted in 26 Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) in 5 cities

**Partnership with Hindustan Unilever in Mumbai**

The key part of this project was to set up MRFs in Mumbai. 
3 MRFs have been set up and 1 more is in progress. 
For all 4 MRFs it is planned to install weighbridges and relevant machinery, obtain insurance for the materials processed and stored, and obtain Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) certification. 
So far 336 waste pickers have been onboarded across the MRFs, and there are plans to onboard 650 more. 
MRFs will organise quarterly medical health camps for waste pickers and workshops that will, among other things, increase gender sensitization and raise awareness about Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA). 
In 2020, these MRFs collected 1,481 tonnes of plastic waste and 1,037 tonnes of plastic waste were processed in a decentralised manner; and it is expected that these numbers will increase.

To support these activities, the following actions have been planned:
* onboard more than 100,000 households to encourage waste segregation at source (17,661 households already onboarded)
* establish new institutional and enterprise partnerships across Mumbai
* establish new partnerships with authorized recyclers
* conduct awareness sessions or webinars with educational institutions and RWAs
* offer reusable masks in exchange for plastic waste through the "Plastic Lao – Mask Pao!" campaign

**Partnership with HDFC Bank**

As part of this project, MRFs have been set up in Goa (in Panaji), 2 in Uttarakhand (in Rishikesh and Dehradun), 2 in New Delhi (in Delhi Cantonment and SDMC); and 2 more are planned. 
So far 649 waste pickers have been onboarded, and there are plans to onboard 150 more. 
Due to COVID-19, all onboarded waste pickers were provided with safety gear including clothing and gloves. 
More than 250 meetings and training sessions have been conducted for waste pickers, and 450 waste pickers have participated in social inclusion activities. 
In these MRFs 1,492 tonnes of plastic waste were processed in 2020, and the amount doubled in 2021. 
To support plastic waste collection, an awareness campaign covered 1,045 households in 2020 and 55 educational institutions in 2021.

**Partnership with Nayara Energy in Gujarat**

This project takes place in 2 cities and 15 villages. 
Baseline studies have been conducted in all locations and consents from Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and rural authorities have been obtained.
An MRF has been set up in Khambhalia; setting up of an MRF in the second city and segregation sheds in the villages is in progress. 
So far 98 waste pickers have been onboarded, and there are plans to onboard 200 more. 
The goals are to establish 10 waste picker SHGs and to organise workshops that will, among other things, increase gender sensitization and raise awareness about PSEA. 
The target for 2022 is to process 600 tonnes of plastic waste.

To support these activities, the following actions have been planned:
* set up data mapping and monitoring systems at all locations
* install 20 Reverse Vending Machines (RVMs)
* conduct 10 Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities and onboard 5,000 households to foster segregation at source
* organise 10 spot beautification activities, including wall paintings

**Partnership with The Coca-Cola India Foundation**

As part of this project, MRFs in 3 cities have been set up with consents from ULBs; and 3 more are planned for 2022. 
So far 268 waste pickers have been onboarded, and there are plans to onboard 200 more. 
90 waste pickers were provided with safety gear including clothing and gloves. 
4 waste picker Self Help Groups (SHGs) have been established, and 5 more are in progress. 
Plans for 2022 include social inclusion and livelihood activities for formalization of waste pickers and recognition of their service to the society, and workshops that will, among other things, increase gender sensitization and raise awareness about PSEA. 
In these 3 MRFs 2,069 tonnes of plastic waste were processed in 2021, and it is expected that these numbers will increase.
To support plastic waste collection, an awareness campaign that will cover 3,000 households is planned for 2022.

### 7. Building Circular Cities in Partnership with Private Sector: Starting from Plastic Waste Management 

**UNDP ID:** 00120259 <br/>
**Dates:** Feb 2020 - Dec 2022 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** Narayanganj, Bangladesh <br/>
**Budget:** 1.10 million USD <br/>
**Funders:** Unilever Bangladesh 83%, UK FCDO, UK DFID, HSBC 

With the aim to create a circular economy model for plastic waste, this project focuses on waste pickers (informal economy) and supply chains for plastic waste (formal economy). 
The project is being implemented in Narayanganj, a city of 2.2 million people located 16 km southeast of Dhaka, the capital. 
In Narayanganj, 800 tonnes of waste are produced daily, of which 50 tonnes are plastic waste. HDPE and LDPE plastics form 30% of the total plastic waste.

In collaboration with waste pickers, the project goals were to:
* introduce an ID card system and to enrol 300 waste pickers
* establish a childcare support programme for 300 children of waste pickers
* train 100 waste pickers in waste management safety
* install 20 bathing and hand washing facilities (WASH facilities) for waste pickers in response to COVID-19

By the end of 2021, the waste management safety training module had been developed and 15 WASH facilities were in progress.

In collaboration with the private sector, the project goals were to:
* develop an economically sustainable plastic collection model
* design a supply chain for collected plastic waste
* collect HDPE and LDPE plastic waste and make it part of the relevant supply chain (in formal economy)

By the end of 2021, baseline assessment of the plastic collection model was almost complete, but the collection of plastic waste had not yet started.

To support the HDPE and LDPE plastic waste collection, the goal was to reach 100,000 people with an awareness campaign that would communicate the importance of segregating plastic waste at source and inform about the new plastic collection system and locations of collection hubs. By the end of 2021, design of the awareness campaign was in progress.

**Conclusion:** Evaluation of benefits of the ID card system and the childcare support programme will determine whether similar projects could contribute to the circular economy for plastic waste in other locations. The awareness campaign, if successful, could be rolled out in other cities in Bangladesh. The implementation of the HDPE and LDPE plastic waste supply chain, from collection to becoming part of new products, will provide valuable lessons that could be used across other waste streams.

**SDG 1 "No Poverty":** To improve the lives of waste pickers, the goals of this projects included enrolling them into an ID card system, training them in waste management safety and installing WASH facilities for them.

**SDG 5 "Gender equality":** One of the goals of the project was to establish a childcare support programme for children of waste pickers.

**SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production":** Development of an economically sustainable plastic collection model and design of a supply chain for collected plastic waste are supposed to contribute to responsible production, while the awareness campaign fosters responsible consumption.








### 14. Technical Support to Strengthen Chemicals and Environment Initiatives

**UNDP ID:** 00117077 <br/>
**Dates:** Jul 2019 - Dec 2020 <br/>
**Location:** New Delhi, India <br/>
**Budget:** 180,000 USD <br/>
**Funders:** UNDP

The project goal was to position UNDP as an implementation partner for future projects aimed at improving management of e-waste and other types of waste that contain mercury.

As part of the project, the following documents have been finalised:
* To foster greater participation of the private sector in the second stage of Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP-II), more than 100 Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) have been signed with the private sector companies under HPMP-II.
* The inter-ministerial steering committee and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) reviewed and finalized the "India: Mercury Initial Assessment" report that includes sector specific National Action Plans, details of regulatory mechanisms and phase out dates for mercury containing products in India. This document is expected to impact healthcare institutions, laboratories and other industries that handle mercury containing products.
* The Project Identification Form (PIF) for a project concerning environmentally sound management of e-waste through sustainable integrated approaches has been endorsed by the MoEFCC for submission to GEF.

**SDG 1 "No Poverty":** The outcomes of this project will benefit people living under the national poverty line as they are disproportionately exposed to toxic substances like mercury, both through informal e-waste recycling and due to living in contaminated areas.

**SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production":** The project was intended to foster greater participation of the private sector in tackling challenges associated with mercury containing products, and to introduce relevant regulatory mechanisms and set phase out dates.

**SDG 15 "Life on land":** The outcomes of this project will protect the environment from mercury contamination.






### 15. Programme Framework of Support in response to Thailand’s development challenges

**UNDP ID:** 00127419 <br/>
**Dates:** Jun 2021 - Aug 2022 (ongoing) <br/>
**Location:** Surat Thani Rajabhat University, Thailand <br/>
**Budget:** 143,500 USD <br/>
**Funders:** UNDP 70%, The Agriculture And Community Development Foundation in Thailand, Government of France

With the aim to promote waste segregation, collection and recycling, and to reduce leakage of waste into the environment, this project focuses on development of a waste bank. The project is being implemented in Surat Thani Rajabhat University, where currently all waste that is collected is disposed of at a private dumpsite without segregation.

By the end of 2021, the conceptual design of the waste bank had been developed, with particular attention to integrating IT solutions with economic incentives and public participation.

The goals for 2022 are to:
* manage at least 50% of the waste (both organic and non-organic) created at university through the waste bank
* estimate the reduction in GHG emissions resulting from improvements in waste management system
* develop a waste bank policy for the university and the nearby community

The success will be measured in tonnes of waste diverted from the dumpsite and CO2-equivalent tonnes of GHG emissions avoided as a result.

**SDG 11 "Sustainable cities and communities":** Creating a local waste management solution for the university will allow it and the nearby community to be more sustainable.

**SDG 12 "Responsible consumption and production":** This project contributes to SDG 12 by fostering waste segregation and recycling, and by working with the private sector to create a more circular economy.
