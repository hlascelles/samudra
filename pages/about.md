  text: Uncollected waste is openly burnt (leading to adverse effects on air quality) or dumped (facilitating the spread of contagious disease and disease vectors). Improving the coverage of waste collection services will lead to better physical and mental health, and reduce the prevalence of contagious diseases.

  text: Women are responsible for waste management in most households and are hence more exposed to the harmful substances released during open burning of waste. Due to a higher proportion of body fat compared to men, they are also more likely to accumulate these harmful substances in larger quantities. Improving the coverage of waste collection services will reduce this inequality.

  text: Even waste that is neither recyclable nor compostable has calorific value. Non-recyclable plastic can be chemically converted into fuel. Using waste as an energy resource will facilitate the shift away from more polluting fuels and produce affordable energy while reducing the environmental pollution at the same time.

  text: Millions of people make a living by participating in the informal waste management sector. They work without protective equipment and they often don't have access to healthcare. Many of them don't have IDs and none of them have a stable income. Creating waste management jobs for these people will result in better work conditions, more stable income, access to healthcare, further education and social safety net.

  text: Income inequality is exacerbated by the availability of waste collection services - low-income communities live in polluted environments and are exposed to harmful substances released during open burning of waste. Improving the coverage of waste collection services will reduce this health inequality and facilitate the economic growth of low-income communities.

  text: Waste washed up on the shores, leachate from dumped waste and ashes from open burning of waste pollute our land. As landfills fill up, need for new ones often results in deforestation of surrounding areas. Capital investment in waste management infrastructure will reduce deforestation and environmental contamination, as well as protect biodiversity and fertility of our land.

Samudra is dedicated to solving global waste management challenges that don't have a profitable solution. 
Here we describe what we do and why we do it, how we are different from other initiatives with similar goals, and how our work directly contributes to 15 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>. 
<hr style="height:10px; visibility:hidden;" />



<h4>Waste collection services for everyone</h4>
Currently only 2 in 3 people worldwide have access to waste collection services. 
Every day 2.6 billion people face a choice of what to do with their waste. 
Some set it on fire, some add it to a dumpsite nearby, some drive long distances to dump it far away from home, some let the current of a nearby river carry their waste away. 
<mark>Ask yourself, what would you do if all the waste in your bin was yours to keep?</mark> 
At Samudra our goal is to minimise the number of people who have to make this choice. 



<h4>Back to front business of waste management</h4>
Think of a successful company that sells a great product. 
How did they achieve that? 
They most likely started with identifying a market niche and learning about the target market segment. 
Then they made decisions about investment in appropriate infrastructure. 
Finally, they identified suppliers that can reliably provide sufficient amounts of the right types of materials required for production. 
If you've ever started a company, you know that none of these steps are easy. 
Now imagine how hard it is to build a successful company if you must follow these steps in reverse order! 
In waste management you don't choose the composition or the amount of generated waste; everything that is produced in your collection area has to be processed. 
You then need to find a market for recyclable materials or products you can make with them yourself, but you cannot guarantee to your customers that you will be able to supply these continuously. 
Often the waste composition changes faster than the infrastructure investment pays off. 
As a result, waste management that doesn't harm the environment or human health is often not profitable. 
At Samudra we are motivated by solving problems, not by profit. 
That is why we decided to tackle global waste management challenges. 



<h4>Maximum impact projects</h4>
Since we are not bound by trying to maximise our profit, we are free to work on projects with the highest potential impact. 
As our first challenge we picked marine plastic pollution because it is an urgent matter. 
It is <abbr title='"Plastic waste inputs from land into the ocean" paper by Jenna R. Jambeck published in Science, 2015'><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768" target="_blank">estimated</a></abbr> that 12 million tonnes of plastic waste ends up in our oceans annually, and the amount is growing every year. 
40% of this plastic pollution originates on land in Southeast Asia, additional 40% comes from other regions and the remaining 20% originates offshore, mainly from fishing, shipping and oil industries. 
It is hard to estimate the amount of plastic already present in our oceans, especially because only 3% of it is floating on the surface. 
One thing is clear - we can prevent more plastic pollution than we could eliminate by collecting the plastic that is already in our oceans. 
Hence our goal is to improve waste collection and treatment systems in Southeast Asia, which has the potential to reduce the amount of annual plastic pollution by 40%. 



<h4>Evidence weights more than believes</h4>
Our aim is to make the world a better place, and the research we do provides us stepping stones along the way. 
Unlike other organisations with similar goals, we don't hold strong beliefs that recycling is always the best solution, that the less plastic we use the better, or that incinerators are more polluting than landfills. 
One reason for that is the fact that very different things often end up under the same blanket term. 
Widely recyclable packaging material that reduces emissions from transportation is very different from holiday decorations that we put up once and throw into the bin the next day. 
A well managed landfill with methane capture in a dry climate is very different from a landfill created by clearing rainforest. 
Another reason why we don't hold strong beliefs is that everything has an opportunity cost. 
These costs can be very different depending on the type of waste and the location where it is produced. 
Recycling something in one part of the world can produce more emissions and environmental pollution than incinerating it at a waste-to-energy facility in another part of the world. 
Chemical recycling of plastic waste can produce fuel that is less polluting than what is currently used in the region. 
That is why we don't advocate for recycling, landfilling or incineration. 
We advocate for taking the time to estimate the costs of different solutions (in terms of finance, environmental pollution, impact on climate and human health) and to compare the opportunity cost. 
In depth research guides everything we do.
