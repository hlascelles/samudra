My name is Karina. My goal is to [stop plastic pollution][1] of our oceans. Apart from this I also work on other [projects]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/projects/) and use all the time and money I have left for [travelling]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/travel/). To fuel my work and travel I do [eat]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/food/) a lot. I enjoy meeting new people in one, two and even three dimentions (also known as email, video calls and in person meetings), please get in touch if you think we could learn something from each other!
